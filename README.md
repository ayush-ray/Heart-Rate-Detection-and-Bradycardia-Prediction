# Heart-Rate-Detection-and-Bradycardia-Prediction

•	Used ECG sensor for collecting data and cleaned the data using FIR filter

•	Implemented R-peak detection algorithm and derived and plotted heart rate from peaks detected and developed an algorithm for Bradycardia prediction using MATLAB

•	Developed an Android application for display of prediction results as per the user by implementing Java
